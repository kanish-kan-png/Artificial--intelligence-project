Machine Learning Projects â€” Spam Mail Detection &amp; Iris Flower Classification  This repository contains two beginner-to-intermediate level Machine Learning projects implemented in Python, showcasing different techniques for text classification and data-based prediction tasks.    

ðŸ“© Spam Mail Detection

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or not spam using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
It involves text preprocessing, feature extraction, and training classification algorithms to accurately detect spam messages.

Highlights:

Text cleaning and preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)

Feature extraction using TF-IDF Vectorization

Model training with Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM

Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Tech Stack:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK/SpaCy, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project demonstrates a supervised machine learning approach to classify Iris flowers into three species â€” Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica â€” based on sepal and petal dimensions.
Itâ€™s a classic dataset used to introduce fundamental ML concepts like data visualization, model training, and evaluation.

Highlights:

Data exploration and visualization

Training models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy metrics

End-to-end ML workflow demonstration

Tech Stack:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook

ðŸŽ¯ Objective

These projects collectively demonstrate the core steps of a machine learning pipeline, including:

Data preprocessing

Feature engineering

Model selection and training

Performance evaluation
